# Healthy Mind Admin

Admin panel for the Healthy Mind application.

Healthy Mind is an Android-based mental health support application consisting of two separate mobile applications: one for users/patients and another for doctors/admins.

The user application allows patients to assess their mental well-being through guided questionnaires, view suitable consultation options, and book doctor appointments.

The doctor/admin application enables doctors to manage appointments, view user responses, and handle basic consultation-related workflows.

The project focuses on building a structured user flow, secure data handling, and a clean Android UI for a sensitive domain like mental health.
